### Executive Summary

This report is presented by Wallaby Consulting for SuperLife’s chief actuary, Jes B. Zane, on suitable health incentive programs to be paired with SuperLife’s existing whole-life and 20-year term policies. The designed program is called EverCare and prioritises key incentive programs, which were selected based on their effectiveness in reducing mortality, as well as the net present value (NPV) of the estimated costs taken to implement each. To provide maximum value to as many policyholders as possible, EverCare encompasses four health intervention programs, as discussed more in Section 3. 

This program is designed to be implemented in January 2025 with a duration of 20 years (the full duration of a term policy). Wallaby Consulting have tested the economic viability of the EverCare program using given historical data and by conducting thorough sensitivity tests for key risks. EverCare has been designed to deliver maximum value to SuperLife, with a 95% certainty, of Č707 bn Net Profit (Č4,449 bn Premiums, Č3,742 bn Death Benefits) as well as an average mortality reduction of 22.23%.
