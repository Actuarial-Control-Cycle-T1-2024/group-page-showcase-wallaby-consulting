## 1. Executive Summary

This report is presented by Wallaby Consulting for SuperLife’s chief actuary, Jes B. Zane, on suitable health incentive programs to be paired with SuperLife’s existing whole-life and 20-year term policies. The designed program is called EverCare and prioritises key incentive programs, which were selected based on their effectiveness in reducing mortality, as well as the net present value (NPV) of the estimated costs taken to implement each. To provide maximum value to as many policyholders as possible, EverCare encompasses four health intervention programs, as discussed more in Section 3. 

This program is designed to be implemented in January 2025 with a duration of 20 years (the full duration of a term policy). Wallaby Consulting have tested the economic viability of the EverCare program using given historical data and by conducting thorough sensitivity tests for key risks. EverCare has been designed to deliver maximum value to SuperLife, with a 95% certainty, of Č707 bn Net Profit (Č4,449 bn Premiums, Č3,742 bn Death Benefits) as well as an average mortality reduction of 22.23%.  


## 4. Pricing and Costs
SuperLife currently offers two long-term insurance products, a single-premium whole life insurance, and a level-premium 20-year term insurance. Our objectives were to price the premiums according to sound actuarial principles, balancing the economic value offered to SuperLife, and the competitiveness to the market. In general, our pricing process involved:
1. Analysis of the provided Inforce Data, and provided mortality tables,
2.  Creation of new mortality tables,
3. Base premium pricing,
4. Expense loading,
5. Cash back margins, and
6. Profitability projections.

### Mortality Analysis
Our first concern when utilising the provided data is whether the provided mortality data (MORTDATA) is a suitable fit for the provided inforce data (INFORCE). We analysed the empirical death probabilities from INFORCE across the provided age range and found that for ages less than 58, the experienced mortality (INFORCE) is higher than predicted and vice versa for ages greater than 58 (Figure 2). To account for this, we needed to stratify the MORTDATA according to the Underwriting Class by calculating an average loading factor of the INFORCE mortality compared to the MORTDATA mortality.

Next, we further stratified the mortality tables according to the projected mortality reductions due to the interventions. There are 4 base interventions and hence 15 combinations of the interventions, for which mortality tables were calculated. With a high degree of certainty, an average reduction of 22.23% is expected after implementing interventions.
The results of this analysis show clear mortality improvements, which can be seen by the life expectancy at birth, using the Low-Risk Underwriting Class, with and without interventions. Similar patterns hold for the other underwriting classes.
